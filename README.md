# ProduceItemRecognition

Produce Item Recognition- Dataset is created from scratch, has train, validation and test set. Train is with 800 images per class, test and validation are with 320 images per class. Totally dataset has 24 classes. I have used VGG16, Resnet50 and CNN for the model training.

Step 1: DataSet can be downloaded either using github or using google drive         (https://drive.google.com/openid=1zGn8_CsleUBuRMfVG7JYnwqjaQtBp5Gl)


Step 2: Install Anaconda with tf-CPU environment.


Required Hardware Configuration - NVIDIA® GPU card with CUDA® Compute Capability 3.5 or higher
Required Software Configuration- NVIDIA® GPU drivers —CUDA 10.1 requires 418.x or higher. CUDA® Toolkit —TensorFlow supports CUDA 10.1 (TensorFlow >= 2.1.0) CUPTI ships with the CUDA Toolkit. cuDNN SDK (>= 7.6)
tf environment comes with tensorflow, but other files libraries like keras, matplotlib, plotly, sklearn, pillow needs to be installed before executing this code. 
              

Step 3: Download any model file ( VGG16, Resnet-50 or CNN)

Step 4: Change dataset path, and  model save and load path in ipynb file according to your local system

Step 5: Run all the cells. 

To execute in google colab, copy the google drive dataset like and export it to your own drive. Follow all steps from step 3 to step 5.
